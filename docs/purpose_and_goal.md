# Purpose and Goal of Creator Views

## Purpose

The purpose of the "Creator" views is to provide a tool for iOS engineers to quickly validate and customize native SwiftUI components. These views will allow developers to interactively modify the properties of a component and see a live preview of the changes.

## Goal

The goal is to create a comprehensive suite of "creator" views for all customizable native SwiftUI components. This will provide a powerful tool for developers to explore the full range of possibilities for each component and to quickly generate code for their own projects.

## Roadmap

We will start by implementing creator views for the "Presentation" components from the HIG. The following is a list of the components we will be implementing, with "Alerts" already completed:

*   Action sheets
*   Page controls
*   Panels
*   Popovers
*   Scroll views
*   Sheets
*   Windows
