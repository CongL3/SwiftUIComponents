# Contributing to SwiftUIComponents

We're excited that you're interested in contributing to this project! Your help is essential for making this the best possible resource for the SwiftUI community.

## üöÄ How to Contribute

There are two main ways you can contribute to this project:

1.  **Implement a new component showcase**: If you see a native SwiftUI component that's missing from our library, we'd love for you to add it.
2.  **Add a code example**: We're always looking for more examples of how to use our components in real-world scenarios.

## ‚úÖ Component Implementation Checklist

When implementing a new component showcase, please make sure to follow these guidelines:

*   **Native First**: The component must be a native SwiftUI component, without any custom styling that obscures its native appearance.
*   **Complete Coverage**: The showcase should demonstrate all available native styles for the component.
*   **Interactive Examples**: The component should be fully interactive, with `@State` bindings for real-time updates.
*   **Clean List Format**: The showcase should follow the project's established list format, with a descriptive title and use case.
*   **Real-time Feedback**: The showcase should provide real-time feedback on the component's current state.

## üìù Code Example Standards

When adding a new code example, please make sure to follow these standards:

*   **Swift String Escaping**: Use `#"""` raw string literals for all code examples.
*   **Complete Implementations**: Include all necessary imports and setup code.
*   **Production Quality**: The code should be production-ready, with error handling, accessibility, and performance optimization.
*   **Live Previews**: The example should include a live preview that demonstrates the component's functionality.
*   **Copy-Paste Ready**: The code should be ready for developers to copy and paste into their own projects.

## üßê Quality Assurance Checklist

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure to review the following:

*   All examples build and run correctly.
*   Proper Swift string escaping is used throughout.
*   Live previews are functional for all examples.
*   Copy-to-clipboard is working for all code snippets.
*   Examples follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.
*   Accessibility features are properly demonstrated.
*   Performance considerations are addressed.
